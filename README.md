Hi👋!!! Thank you for visiting my profile!

I'm Arantxa Constanzo, UC Civil Constructor about to have my Master's in Construction and with total pride a Web Developer from the Henry Academy 🚀. I love design in all its senses and that is why my orientation is towards the Front-End👩🏽‍💻, my experience is focused on web development with the Javascript language using technologies such as: React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Ant Design , Bootstrap, Node, Express and SQL.

I am extremely excited to grow in my professional career in the technological and business fields and in a future under construction, in such a way as to complement my professional career with Henry, which is what I love. I am open to opportunities that allow me to apply my skills and knowledge effectively.
